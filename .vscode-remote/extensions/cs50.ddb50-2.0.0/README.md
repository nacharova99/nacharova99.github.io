Provide everyone with their own virtual duck on VS Code and introduce students to the concept of rubber duck debugging. This is a technique that involves talking to a rubber duck (or any inanimate, or even animate object) about a bug in their code.

Now, with the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT, your rubber duck can talk back! The ddb50 extension leverages ChatGPT to provide a conversational coding experience, further enriching the practice of rubber duck debugging. This approach gives students a more dynamic way to address and discuss code issues.
